## Code Overivew :

* Code file is in jupyter notebook and my_model.h5 is trained model. Data is big so it will take time to train model. But if we don't want to run model again then we can directly use trained model.

* I have used LSTM ( Long short term memory) for sentiment analysis. I got 94% accuracy. Code is explained in jupyer notebook file.

## Tkinter UI :

* It is a window application which asked for review as input and it uses trained model to predict whether review is positive or not.
